# mapmapper

A project to make mapping between databases and clojure somewhat less painful.

Right now, it's mostly focused on SQL generation, since I was previously relying on korma and realised it wasn't super friendly for manipulating with code in the way that something ORM-like may want to.

## Usage

Right now, we're just building out SQL generation. You'll want to look at the test suite for some examples.
